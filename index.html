                <p>Welcome to The Lower Hamptons! Thank you for looking after our plant babies and Percy. And, hopefully, your lovely self!</p>
                <p>We're sure you're doing a great job. This site is just to provide reminders if you need it, and in the case of plant-care, should you choose to go above and beyond and pursue The Way of the Plant-Hero.</p> 
                <p><em>Please remember:</em> minimum contractual obligation is simply for not all of the plants to die, so if you water (most) of them at least once, that's probably fine!</p>

                        <figcaption>The heliotrope loves wet feet, so as often as possible, aim to water it every 2 days or so. It likes when there's a little water seeping out into the bowl. Its leaves are always browning a bit, but this is slowed down by keeping it constantly drenched. It must be a swamp creature!</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The swedish ivy is pretty hardy, but appreciates as much water, or more, than the spider plants. This is also compounded by the tiny pot that it is in. Basically, water it as often as you think of it.<br>

                        <figcaption>The amaryllis likes to be moderately damp, since it's fast-growing, but it shouldn't be sitting in a pool of water like heliotrope or lemon tree. Once a week should be fine, but maybe a little more often if it's looking limp.</figcaption>

                    <p>Basically, this means the succulents (cactuses, etc.) and epiphytes (hoyas). When you touch the soil and press your finger into it a little ways, it should feel very dry before considering watering them.</p>

                        <figcaption>The string-of-pearls and the burros' tails both like to get really dried out, then drenched until water is running out the bottom of the pot. I usually accomplish this by unhooking the pots, taking them to the sink, turning on the spray button as gently as possible, and filling the pot 2 or 3 times with water, then letting it drain into the sink until it's barely dripping. Then I put them back.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The cactus will be fine if you never water it. If you feel called to water it, only give it a little dribble, as the bowl it's in doesn't have any drainage, and it hates wet feet.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Like the above succulents, the hoyas prefer to dry out completely and then be watered a lot. They <em>hate</em> wet feet, that is why they are on rocks – to keep their roots from touching water which may drip into their saucers.<br>
                        <br>
                        Note: the smallest hoya, pictured above with the diamond shaped-leaves, should be watered more often than the big ones because its tiny pot dries out faster. Please give it a good drenching once it feels very dry to the touch.

                <p>Percival Rose is pretty independent, though she does enjoy some snuggles now and again, or sitting next to you on the couch. She prefers to be picked up and held like a baby than over-the-shoulder. </p>

                <p>She has two cat doors: one in the laundry room that goes directly to the outside, and one in door to barn, on the way to the exterior woodshed. She comes and goes as she pleases.</p>
                <p>Note: we try to discourage her from going in and out through the mudroom door, because sometimes she scratches at the weather-stripping.</p>

                <p>She should always have food and water available at her station near the laundry room cat door. Food is stored above the washing machine. Sometimes she also drinks out of the big watering can if you leave water in it. She also likes to drink from the papyrus buckets, so I've set out a bowl of water for her under the plant bench, near the papyrii, to give her a cleaner water option.</p>
                <p>She mostly goes outside for bathroom needs, but we keep the kitty litter in the laundry for cold days just in case, and she does use it occasionally.</p>

                    <p>If you don't already have it, the wifi info is on the side of the fridge. In the event of an outage, we are with Xplornet and the router is beside the lemon tree. Very limited cell signal is available by putting some cell phones in the upstairs windows.</p>

                <article class="mouse-traps">
                    <h4 id="mouse-traps">Mouse Trap(s)</h4>
                    <p>We try to always keep a mouse-trap somewhere in the kitchen, or the hole under the rug and board in the bedroom closet. If we don't regularly catch mice, they tend to run all over the sink counter and kitchen shelf, and get into the drawers as well. Sometimes we put a mouse-trap in the tea-towel drawer, which is why there is a sign there. We move the trap(s) around depending on where we see signs of mice.</p>
                    <p>We've been trying different mouse-traps this year, and our current favourite is a battery-operated electric one:</p>
                    <img class="mouse-trap">
                    <p>There are instructions on the bottom of it, but basically, you want to turn it 'off' by pushing the slider OVER the '|' symbol (so that the '0' is visible). Then disconnect the kill chamber by sliding it forward and separating it from the battery chamber. Check for mice inside, replace bait if needed.</p>
                    <p>Note: the bait can't touch the metal plate, or it may interfere with delivering the shock.</p>
                    <p>We also have snap-traps on the router shelf, by the lemon tree. Something has been eating the bait off of these traps often enough that we invested in the electric trap, but we have caught a number of mice with the snap traps.</p>

                <h4 id="kindling-tinder">Kindling & Tinder</h4>
                <p>We have boxes/crates of bark and small pieces of wood that make great kindling and/or tinder for firestarting. They're pretty dry, but if you want an extra easy time of it, dry it on the drying baskets above the pots for a few days before you need it.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="HMR pics/house-1-drying-baskets.jpg">

                </figure>
                <p>You are also, of course, welcome to chop proper kindling, there's a small maul-style axe good for doing so in the mudroom.</p> 
                <p>Pro-lumberjack-tip: choose a piece of wood that the grain looks straighter on to have an easier time splitting it into little pieces.</p>

                <h4 id="carpets">Carpets</h4>
                <p>The bedroom carpets, including the grey hummingbird carpet in the closet, are fancy, hand-woven treasured objects from Mexico. If you or a visitor have a pet prone to damaging/scratching at/otherwise being rough on carpets, please role them up and put them somewhere out of reach of said pet. Otherwise, enjoy them if you like lying on the floor and/or doing yoga, or any other floor-related activities!</p>

                <h4 id="compost">Compost</h4>
                <p>AKA "Garden Food" as the bucket hanging by the kitchen sink says. The pile is in the exterior pen of the old chicken coop in the back yard – the pen keeps Fayette (Larry's dog) and others out of it.</p>
                <p>Please note: we try to avoid putting bones and other meat products in the compost to try to discourage rats. This may not have been effective, as there is some sort of creature nest tunneled into the pile that we haven't identified. We generally burn meat scraps and bones, and then dump them in the gardens with the ash. Egg shells and dairy scraps are compost in our eyes.</p>

                <h4 id="supplementary-heating">Supplementary Heating</h4>
                <p>There is a propane heater on the north wall (across from the couch) that we never use. The tank is half-full, so if you want to use it, the remote to control it lives on it. There might be an on-switch on the heating unit itself somewhere as well (I don't remember because we never use it).</p>
                <p>There are also electric baseboards. The thermostat above the couch controls them. If you want to go away for longer than a day, and it's cold enough out, you can turn them to 15 or so, just to make sure that pipes don't freeze. There are 5 baseboard units, one under each window on the ground floor (2 in the dining room, 2 in the living room, and 1 in the corner-storage room).</p>
                <p><em>Please Note:</em> in the past, someone has turned on the baseboards without knowing there was one in the corner room, and melted the side of a plastic tote container. Probably this is the worst that would happen (and that's not terrible) <span class="all-caps">but</span> in the interests of avoiding fire disaster, please make sure nothing is touching or too-close to the baseboards if you turn them on.</p>
