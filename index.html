                <p>Welcome to The Lower Hamptons! Thank you for looking after our plant babies and Percy. And, hopefully, your lovely self!</p>
                <p>We're sure you're doing a great job. This site is just to provide reminders if you need it, and in the case of plant-care, should you choose to go above and beyond and pursue The Way of the Plant-Hero.</p> 
                <p><em>Please remember:</em> minimum contractual obligation is simply for not all of the plants to die, so if you water (most) of them at least once, that's probably fine!</p>

                <h2>Plant-Hero's Journey</h2>
                <p>We are grateful for any basic-plant-care regimen, consisting of checking the plants to see if they need water about 1x/week. You are a much appreciated <em>Plant-Devotee</em>!</p>
                <p>However, if you wish to follow <em>The Way of the Plant-Hero</em>, there are basically two extra-care considerations:</p>

                    <p>Basically, this means the succulents (cactuses, etc.) and epiphytes (hoyas). When you touch the soil and press your finger into it a little ways, it should feel very dry before considering watering them.</p>

                        <figcaption>The string-of-pearls and the burros' tails both like to get really dried out, then drenched until water is running out the bottom of the pot. I usually accomplish this by unhooking the pots, taking them to the sink, turning on the spray button as gently as possible, and filling the pot 2 or 3 times with water, then letting it drain into the sink until it's barely dripping. Then I put them back.</figcaption>

                        <br>
                        Note: the smallest hoya, pictured above with the diamond shaped-leaves, should be watered more often than the big ones because its tiny pot dries out faster. Please give it a good drenching once it feels very dry to the touch.

Its leaves are always browning a bit, but this is slowed down by keeping it constantly drenched. It must be a swamp creature!</figcaption>

                <p>Percival Rose is pretty independent, though she does enjoy some snuggles now and again, or sitting next to you on the couch. She prefers to be picked up and held like a baby rather than over-the-shoulder. </p>

                <p>She has two cat doors: one in the laundry room that goes directly to the outside, and one in door to barn, on the way to the exterior woodshed. She comes and goes as she pleases.</p>
                <p>Note: we try to discourage her from going in and out through the mudroom door, because sometimes she scratches at the weather-stripping.</p>

                <p>She should always have food and water available at her station near the laundry room cat door. Food is stored above the washing machine. Sometimes she also drinks out of the big watering can if you leave water in it. She also likes to drink from the papyrus buckets, so I've set out a bowl of water for her under the plant bench, near the papyrii, to give her a cleaner water option.</p>
                <p>She mostly goes outside for bathroom needs, but we keep the kitty litter in the laundry for cold days just in case, and she does use it occasionally.</p>

                    <h4>Ashes</h4>
                    <p>We empty ashes onto the gardens, which you can see fences around in the backyard. There's a bucket by the store, as well as a drawer under the stove that can be used. The drawer is supposed to catch ashes that you brush into it through a tiny trap door, so we don't bother, we just use the little ash shovel.</p>

                    <p>The bedroom carpets, including the grey hummingbird carpet in the closet, are fancy, hand-woven treasured objects from Mexico. If you or a visitor have a pet prone to damaging/scratching at/otherwise being rough on carpets, please role them up and put them somewhere out of reach of said pet. Otherwise, enjoy them if you like lying on the floor and/or doing yoga, or any other floor-related activities!</p>

                    <p>AKA "Garden Food" as the bucket hanging by the kitchen sink says. The pile is in the exterior pen of the old chicken coop in the back yard – the pen keeps Fayette (Larry's dog) and others out of it.</p>
                    <p>Please note: we try to avoid putting bones and other meat products in the compost to try to discourage rats. This may not have been effective, as there is some sort of creature nest tunneled into the pile that we haven't identified. We generally burn meat scraps and bones, and then dump them in the gardens with the ash. Egg shells and dairy scraps are compost in our eyes.</p>

                    <p>It helps move some of the heat from upstairs downstairs, since the ground floor tends to be very cold (uninsulated basement). The switch is on the square pillar at the bottom of the stairs. We usually keep it on all day, and turn it off at night because we don't like the noise it makes, but you do you!</p>

There are bulk foot items in the rubbermaid bin under the frankenstein pantry beside the door (the milk crates and a short hutch), and in bins in the basement, which are labelled with their contents. Please leave the parmesan cheese to age, but if you like pungent, aged goat cheeses, try the marcellin in the jars. </p>

                    <p>Bottled kombucha is in the basement, and a mother-scoby is in the large glass jar in the same box as the bottles. Feel free to brew some up while you're here, if you want a special flavour, or enjoy the pre-bottled stuff and leave the mother-scoby in the basement until we get back.</p>

                <article id="keys">
                    <h4>Keys</h4>
                    <p>We never lock the house ourselves, but if you want to there are keys to what we call the "front door" which leads from the small porch into the mudroom, and the "mudroom door". You'll notice the other front door is locked and taped shut for winter. Keys are hanging on the L-shaped shelf by the mudroom door, and labelled "HMR" for "Hampton Mountain Road".</p>
                    <p>The workshop at the other end of the property is sort-of available to us, and sort-of off-limits, as the land-folks didn't want to deal with cleaning it up properly, and store some old tools in there, so it's kept locked. We do have a key for it, and use it for some minor storage, and should you need to get in there, the key is hanging beside the front door on your way out.</p>
                    <p>There's a bowl of keys near the lemon tree, including a key for An's trailer, which is parked down near the workshop, if someone needs it.</p>
                    <p><span class="all-caps">Note:</span> there is a key that lives in the inside keyhole of the mudroom door. This is because that door doesn't latch, it just kinda wedges shut, and if it's very windy it might blow open. So the key allows locking the door in place of latching it, to keep it shut, and hopefully without locking people in.</p>

                <article id="mouse-traps">
                    <h4>Mouse Traps</h4>
                    <p>We try to always keep a mouse-trap somewhere in the kitchen, or the hole under the rug and board in the bedroom closet. If we don't regularly catch mice, they tend to run all over the sink counter and kitchen shelf, and get into the drawers as well. Sometimes we put a mouse-trap in the tea-towel drawer, which is why there is a sign there. We move the trap(s) around depending on where we see signs of mice.</p>
                    <p>We've been trying different mouse-traps this year, and our current favourite is a battery-operated electric one, which is on the window sill near the sink.</p>
                    <img class="mouse-trap">
                    <p>There are instructions on the bottom of it, but basically, you want to turn it 'off' by pushing the slider OVER the '|' symbol (so that the '0' is visible). Then disconnect the kill chamber by sliding it forward and separating it from the battery chamber. Check for mice inside, replace bait if needed.</p>
                    <p>Note: the bait can't touch the metal plate, or it may interfere with delivering the shock.</p>
                    <p>We also have snap-traps beside the oven and underneath the bottom-left drawer (remove the drawer to access it), which are in little huts that Paul built to try to force the mice into the best killing position -- it's a whole thing.</p>

                    <h4>Plant Lights</h4>
                    <p>The LED plant lights on the ground floor and in the bedroom have magenta, blue, and red settings. Switch it up if you like! Do so by pressing the middle button once, quickly, to cycle through the different color settings.</p>
                    <p>To turn them off, which we usually do at night, hold the power button down for 3 seconds. If you don't hold it quite long enough, 1 of the 3 lights might turn off – just repeat the hold-for-3-secs process.</p>

                <article id="power-outage">
                    <h4>Power Outage</h4>
                    <p>Emergency candles in the bottom right cupboard of the beige hutch/frankenpantry.</p>
                    <p>The house will soon be out of potable water, so we fill a carbuoy if weather forecasts suggest the power might go out. You can find it in the "barn", which is what we call the structure that connects to the mudroom. We also fill the bathtub, and use that to flush the toilet upstairs. 
                    <p>Internet will also go out, unless you source a power source for the router. If you borrow a generator, or a battery-bank, we have a properly-rated power bar that is bright yellow, with the word "protected" on it, that you can safely plug sensitive electronic devices into while receiving power from a generator. It's in the rubbermaid with tools near the barn door.</p>
                    <p>It sometimes happens that when the power goes out, the water pressure is lost and running water will not return when the power returns. If this happens, the water pump in the basement needs to be reset. We think this happens when you continue to use the water until the pressure is completely lost – it's possible to flush the upstairs toilet a few times, or run a little water, with the remaining pressure during a power outage.</p>
                    <p>If you do drain the pressure, the pump reset is in the basement, to the side of the cold water tank at the bottom of the stairs. Refer to the photos below for details about where to find the very small switch that is quite difficult to find. (If you can't find it, contact Ember as they know exactly where it is and can swing by and show you, as they had to do for us recently!)</p>

                    <h4>Supplementary Heating</h4>
                    <p>There is a propane heater on the north wall (across from the couch) that we never use. The tank is half-full, so if you want to use it, the remote to control it lives on it. There might be an on-switch on the heating unit itself somewhere as well (I don't remember because we never use it).</p>
                    <p>There are also electric baseboards. The thermostat above the couch controls them. If you want to go away for longer than a day, and it's cold enough out, you can turn them to 15 or so, just to make sure that pipes don't freeze. There are 5 baseboard units, one under each window on the ground floor (2 in the dining room, 2 in the living room, and 1 in the corner-storage room).</p>
                    <p><em>Please Note:</em> in the past, someone has turned on the baseboards without knowing there was one in the corner room, and melted the side of a plastic tote container. Probably this is the worst that would happen (and that's not terrible) <span class="all-caps">but</span> in the interests of avoiding fire disaster, please make sure nothing is touching or too-close to the baseboards if you turn them on.</p>

                    <h4>Tools</h4>
                    <p>If you need hand or power tools, they are mostly in the mudroom. During the winter, we keep batteries for the battery-operated power tools (ie: the drill, driver, mitre saw, and chainsaw) in the corner storage room, next to the laundry room. We also, for convenience's sake, keep the drill and driver in there in their bag with all their bits. Please don't leave the batteries in the mudroom where they can freeze, as this isn't good for their lifespan. The tools themselves are fine to be in freezing temperatures, however.</p>

                    <p>If you don't already have it, the wifi info is on the side of the fridge. In the event of an outage, we are with Xplore and the router is beside the lemon tree. Very limited cell signal is available by putting some cell phones in the upstairs windows.</p>
